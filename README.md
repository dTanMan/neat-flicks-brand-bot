# NFbb: Neat Flicks Brand Bot

Neat Flicks has -- as the name implies -- a lot of neat flicks, being the best online video-streaming platform for everyone's favorite movies. However, having a good product is only half of the equation; people should *know* we have good products. Maintaining our identity is just as important as maintaining our products. The more tarnished our name becomes, the harder it'll be to defend the quality of our products to customers; especially those who have never experienced our services first-hand.

Cue, our bb: more specifically, `NFbb`, or **N**eat **F**licks **b**rand **b**ot. Any of our employees will be able to quickly but systematically report to us about anything that has been affecting our brand positively or negatively through chatting with `NFbb`. The `/report` functionality will bring up the relevant conversational form to receive the information.

On the back end, relevant information will be pushed to two databases, one MongoDB and one Postgres database; both of which can be queried by our Marketing department later on.

`NFbb` is excited to meet you. `/register` and `/report` now!

This is a recontextualized open-source version of a project I made in PLDT. Neat Flicks, is of course, meant to be a fictitious company. And this, is meant to be a part of my portfolio.

It's similar in that there's a bot made using the `python-telegram-bot` library; but the context has been changed so as not to reveal anything confidential from my previous work. Some of the functionality may appear similar, but that's because it's using the same library. Both are inspired by standup bots popular in Slack.
